<b>ONLINE PNR AND SEAT AVAILABILITY QUERY TIMINGS :</b><br>
The online PNR and seat availability queries are fetched from the computerized reservation applications.These online reservation applications are shut down daily around 2330 hrs to 0030 hrs IST.
Due to the dynamic changes taking place in the PNR status updation and the availability positions, these two types of queries have to be fetched from the online reservation applications, hence the non- availability of them after certain timings. The sheer size of these databases does not allow them to be copied over network lines.Please note that the web site is functional 24 hrs. a day and other queries (trains between any two stations, fare queries, etc.) are functional throughout the day.

<p class="qstn">
<b>NETWORK CONNECTIVITY FAILURES :</b><br>
Please read the above paragraph. As mentioned in it, for the PNR and seat availability queries, the result is fetched from the computerized reservation applications at the five sites, viz. New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Secunderabad. If there is any network link failure, or if the network lines are very congested, then this error message is displayed. It might so happen, that you are getting seat availability and PNR information for say trains originating from New Delhi and Kolkata, but not for trains originating from Mumbai.
